# IziShopin - Enhanced B2B Marketplace

## Project Overview

IziShopin has been enhanced with user-specific shop profiles, role-based authentication, and mobile-first design with glass morphism effects. The platform now supports multiple user roles with tailored experiences for each.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. User-Specific Shop Profiles
- **Before**: Single static shop profile page
- **After**: Dynamic, user-specific shop profiles with unique URLs (`/shop/:slug`)
- Each shop owner can create and manage their own shop
- Role-based views: shop owners see management interface, customers see shopping interface

### 2. Enhanced Registration System
- **Multi-step registration process** with progress indicators
- **Role-based registration**: Different fields based on selected role
- **Shop creation during registration**: Shop owners can create their shop immediately
- **Form validation** with real-time feedback
- **Password strength indicator**

### 3. Role-Based Authentication
- **Four user roles**: Customer, Shop Owner, Casual Seller, Delivery Agent
- **Role-specific dashboards** and navigation
- **Protected routes** based on user permissions
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token management

### 4. Mobile-First Glass Morphism Design
- **Glass navigation bar** with backdrop blur effects
- **Mobile-optimized layouts** with responsive breakpoints
- **Touch-friendly interactions** with proper sizing
- **Smooth animations** and transitions
- **Progressive enhancement** from mobile to desktop

### 5. Backend API Integration
- **Flask REST API** with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **User management** with role-based access control
- **Shop management** endpoints
- **CORS support** for frontend-backend communication
- **Database models** for users and shops
